# Summary
The subdomain `bug-bounty-2024.matrix.[redacted]`, along with all other subdomains under `*.[redacted]`, are vulnerable to email spoofing due to the absence of a properly configured DMARC record on the organizational domain `[redacted]`. Without DMARC protection, attackers can spoof email addresses using these domains, which could be exploited in phishing or social engineering attacks.

# Steps to Reproduce
1. Use a DNS lookup tool such as [MXToolbox](https://mxtoolbox.com) or the `dig` command to check for a DMARC record on the root domain `[redacted]`.
2. Observe that there is **no DMARC record published**, or the policy is set to `none`, meaning spoofed emails are not blocked or quarantined.
3. Attempt to send an email using a spoofed "From" address like `admin@[redacted]` or `support@[redacted]` to a Gmail or Outlook address.
4. Note that the email is delivered without SPF/DKIM/DMARC enforcement, confirming spoofing is possible.

# Impact
Without a DMARC policy in place at `[redacted]`, malicious actors can spoof emails from any subdomain under `*.[redacted]`, including deeply nested ones like `bug-bounty-2024.matrix.[redacted]`. These spoofed emails can appear legitimate to users and email systems, making them ideal for phishing, credential theft, fraud, and impersonation of trusted services. This increases the risk of user compromise and reputational damage to the organization.

# Remediation
Publish a valid DMARC record at the root organizational domain `[redacted]` to protect all subdomains. For example:
```
_dmarc.[redacted]. IN TXT "v=DMARC1; p=reject; rua=mailto:dmarc-reports@example.com"
```

# Remediation
- Set the policy (`p`) to `quarantine` or `reject` to enforce spoofing protection.
- Optionally, publish explicit DMARC records for critical subdomains that send email.
- Monitor reports using the `rua` tag to fine-tune policies and detect abuse.
